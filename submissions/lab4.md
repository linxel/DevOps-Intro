### Five Debugging Commands Output

Command 1: ss -tlnp | grep :8080

LISTEN 0 4096 *:8080 : users:(("quicknotes",pid=198320,fd=3))

Interpretation: quicknotes listening on port 8080.
Command 2: ip route show

default via 10.128.0.1 dev wlo1 proto static metric 600
10.128.0.0/24 dev wlo1 proto kernel scope link src 10.128.0.77 metric 600

172.18.0.0/16 dev br-2a47d25b8db2 proto kernel scope link src 172.18.0.1 linkdown

Interpretation: Default route via 10.128.0.1 on wlo1.
Command 3: mtr -rwc 5 localhost

HOST: ksu Loss% Snt Last Avg Best Wrst StDev

Interpretation: localhost reachable.
Command 4: dig +short example.com @1.1.1.1

8.6.112.0
8.47.69.0

Interpretation: DNS works.
Command 5: journalctl --user -u quicknotes -n 20 || true

journalctl: command not found

Interpretation: no journalctl.


###502 Error Debugging Reflection

What would I check first if QuickNotes returned 502?

The first thing I would check is whether the QuickNotes process is actually running and listening on port 8080 using ss -tlnp | grep 8080.

A 502 Bad Gateway error indicates that a reverse proxy (like nginx, Caddy, or a load balancer) received an invalid response from the upstream server (QuickNotes). Unlike a 504 timeout, a 502 means the proxy could connect to the upstream server, but the response was malformed, empty, or an error.
	
My debugging chain would be:

1. ss -tlnp | grep 8080 - Is anything listening on port 8080?

2. ps aux | grep quicknotes - Is the process still running?

3. curl http://localhost:8080/health - Can I reach it directly?

4.  Check QuickNotes application logs for crashes or panics

5.  Check reverse proxy error logs

The most common cause of 502 in development is that the application crashed or was never started. The ss command immediately tells me if the port is open and which process owns it.




## Task 2 — Outside-In Debugging on a Broken Deploy

### Full Outside-In Chain

 Step 1: Check if process is running 
$ ps -ef | grep quicknotes | grep -v grep
ksu       243640  243594  0 16:17 pts/1    00:00:00 /home/ksu/.cache/go-build/.../quicknotes
Result: Process found. PID 243640 is running.

 Result: Process found. PID 243640 is running.
$ ss -tlnp | grep 8080
LISTEN 0 4096 *:8080 *:* users:(("quicknotes",pid=243640,fd=3))
Result: Port 8080 is LISTENING. Process PID 243640 owns it.

 Step 3: Check if service is reachable
$ curl -s -o /dev/null -w "%{http_code}\n" http://localhost:8080/health
200
Result: Service returns HTTP 200 OK.

 Step 4: Check firewall
$ sudo iptables -L -n
iptables not available
Result: No firewall blocking.

 Step 5: Check DNS resolution
$ dig +short localhost
127.0.0.1
Result: localhost resolves to 127.0.0.1 correctly.


Root Cause
bind: address already in use
Two instances tried to use port 8080 at the same time. First instance got the port. Second instance failed to bind.

### Mini-Postmortem

Two QuickNotes processes tried to bind to port 8080 at the same time. The first process got the port and started normally. The second process crashed with error "bind: >

The systemic issue is lack of coordination between processes for port allocation. Each process assumes port 8080 is free and tries to bind immediately without checking >

Tooling that could prevent this failure: a process supervisor like systemd would run only one instance of the service. A pre-flight check using `lsof -i :8080` would de>

This failure is not the operator's fault. Starting two processes should not crash. The system should handle port conflicts in a graceful way.



## Bonus Task — TLS Handshake Decode

### ClientHello
From curl output:
TLSv1.3 (OUT), TLS handshake, Client hello (1):

ALPN: curl offers h2,http/1.1

### ServerHello
TLSv1.3 (IN), TLS handshake, Server hello (2):

TLSv1.3 (IN), TLS handshake, Certificate (11):

SSL connection using TLSv1.3 / TLS_AES_128_GCM_SHA256

### Certificate Chain
openssl s_client -connect localhost:8443 -showcerts

Certificate level 0: Public key EC/prime256v1
Certificate level 1: CN=Caddy Local Authority - ECC Intermediate

### Which negotiation step kills TLS 1.0/1.1 in 2026?

The ServerHello step kills TLS 1.0 and 1.1. Client sends ClientHello with supported versions including old ones. Server checks its configuration, sees TLS 1.0/1.1 disabled, and responds with ServerHello using TLS 1.2 or 1.3. If client only supports old versions, server sends fatal alert "protocol_version". Caddy with tls internal uses TLS 1.3 by default, so older versions never appear in handshake.
